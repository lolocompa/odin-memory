# Odin Memory Game

This project is a memory card game built with React, inspired by the popular anime series "One Piece". The game challenges players to match pairs of cards without repeating their choices. It's a fun way to test and improve your memory!

## Features

- **Dynamic Card Shuffling**: Every time the game starts or resets, the cards are shuffled to ensure a unique experience for each playthrough.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the current score and the best score achieved during the session.
- **Winning Message**: Upon successfully matching all pairs without errors, a winning message is displayed.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted with a responsive layout to ensure a great experience on various devices and screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Simply load the game, and you will see a grid of facedown cards.
2. **Flip a Card**: Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its character.
3. **Match Cards**: Try to find and click on the matching card. If the match is correct, both cards will remain face up.
4. **Avoid Repeating**: Clicking on a card that has already been revealed and matched will reset your progress.
5. **Win the Game**: Match all pairs of cards with the fewest clicks possible to win.
